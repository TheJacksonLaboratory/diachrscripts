    "# Select baited digests with imbalances in the configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "We identified two types of baited digests with imbalances in the configurations of unbalanced interactions. For the one type, interactions with the configurations `03` and `13` predominate (BDC1) and, for the other type, interactions with the configuration `12` and `02` predominate (BDC2). We developed a score that rewards such imbalances and thus can be used to define corresponding baited digests at a chosen threshold. In this notebook, two BED files are created, one for each of the two baited digest types. These files are intended to be used to integrate singnals from other sources, such as chromatin accessibility, across the ends of multiple baited digests."
