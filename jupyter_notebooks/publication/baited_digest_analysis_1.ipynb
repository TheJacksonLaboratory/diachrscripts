We first determine the two sums of the interaction counts for the configurations and enrichment states associated with the two classes BDC1 and BDC2. Then we divide the smaller sum by the larger sum. To avoid divisions by zero, we add a pseudo count to both sums. If the score is smaller than a pre-specified threshold, then we assign the baited digests to the BDC1 or BDC2 class. Depending on which of the two sums is larger, we assign the baited digest to BDC1 or BDC2.
