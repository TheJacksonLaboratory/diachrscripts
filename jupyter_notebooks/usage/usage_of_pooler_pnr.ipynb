    "<a href=\"https://diachromatic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\" target=\"__blank\">Diachromatic</a> is a Java application that implements a capture Hi-C preprocessing pipeline followed by analysis of differential chromatin interactions (“loopings”). The diachromatic pipeline transforms the data contained in a FASTQ file from a Hi-C or capture Hi-C experiment to an interaction file that records the chromosomal positions of the two interacting restriction fragments together with some additional information.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>For some analyses presented in \"Using paired-end read orientations to assess and mitigate technical biases in capture Hi-C\", we use Diachromatic to process multiple input files (e.g., representing the same experiment or cell type) separately, and then combine the interaction files for downstream analysis.</p>\n",
    "<p>In this notebook, we describe how to use the python script `pooler.py` to combine paired-end read counts of interactions from different Diachromatic interaction files. Two interactions are considered equal if they have the same restriction fragment coordinates. Interactions with the same fragment coordinates are pooled by summing the read pair counts separately for the four relative paired-end read orientations. For instance, the two interactions:\n",
