In addition, the script also selects two equally sized reference sets of balanced and unbalanced interactions that have nearly identical distributions of total read pair counts per interaction. The interaction categories are:\n",

For example, for a dataset with `2,327,311` interactions, it took about two and a half hours to perform `1000` iterations in `10` parallel threads.
